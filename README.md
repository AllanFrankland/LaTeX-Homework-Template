latex-homework-template
=======================

This LaTeX is a cleanup of jdavis' template here: https://github.com/jdavis/latex-homework-template

Nothing about this template has been changed except the structure. I have divided the structure up into a preamable, frontmatter and mainmatter to allow for a more organised
folder structure. I have also divided each problem up into its own .tex file to allow for better encapsulation of the folder. The overall goal was to lessen cognitive load and
the amount of chaos going on in a single file.

## Features

Here are just a few features of this homework template.

1. Title page.
2. Problem markers.
3. Configurable problem numbers (see the last 3 problems for an example).
4. Some commonly used math macros.
